[11:58 PM] ShadowFox: ðŸ’¬ The Angel was attacked.

[12:01 PM] MidnightRaven: ðŸ’¬ I know, I was watching the private feed. Thankfully I was able to redirect the broadcast to the pre-record before the bloodbath began.

[12:03 PM] ShadowFox: ðŸ’¬ Good. Make sure the media keeps this under wraps. Last thing we need is a public crisis. 

[12:04 PM] MidnightRaven: ðŸ’¬ Agreed. I have my personnel tracking down survivors as we speak. Will push out a wipe when finished.

[12:39 PM] ShadowFox: ðŸ’¬ Discretion is paramount. Weâ€™re treading on a razorâ€™s edge. Any slip and we risk exposure. Ensure all channels are secure.

[12:42 PM] MidnightRaven: ðŸ’¬ Understood. Iâ€™ll handle it with utmost precision. Whatâ€™s our timeline for action?

[12:45 PM] ShadowFox: ðŸ’¬ Aim to have our candidates and media narratives set within two weeks. By then, the public will be too engulfed in the spectacle to notice our moves.

[12:48 PM] MidnightRaven: ðŸ’¬ Got it. Iâ€™ll keep you updated on our progress. Stay sharp.

[12:51 PM] ShadowFox: ðŸ’¬ Always. This is our moment. Letâ€™s make sure we leverage it to its fullest.

[12:54 PM] MidnightRaven: ðŸ’¬ Agreed. Onward and upward.
