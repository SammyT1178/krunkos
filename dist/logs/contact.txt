Aether: ðŸ’¬ [Secure Connection Established]
Aether: ðŸ’¬ Vesper, I have a task that requires your expertise. Are you available?

Vesper: ðŸ’¬ Aether, don't recognize your tag. 

Aether: ðŸ’¬ Prefer to stay anonymous. My identity is of no concern to you.  

Vesper: ðŸ’¬ Whatâ€™s the job?

Aether: ðŸ’¬ A data chip containing highly valuable information. Itâ€™s currently in the possession of a group in the Scrapyard. Your mission is to retrieve itâ€”intact and undamaged.

Vesper: ðŸ’¬ Sounds simple enough. Whatâ€™s on this chip that makes it worth my time?

Aether: ðŸ’¬ [Message encrypted. Decodingâ€¦ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ] The contents are sensitive and valuable to the right parties. Letâ€™s just say itâ€™s not something that should fall into the wrong hands.

Vesper: ðŸ’¬ Sensitive, valuable, and discreet. Got it. How much are we talking?

Aether: ðŸ’¬ [Transferring â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ] 150,000 gold. Half now, half upon delivery. The funds will be routed through a secure channel, no questions asked.

Vesper: ðŸ’¬ Generous offer. Whatâ€™s the catch?

Aether: ðŸ’¬ [Glitch detected: â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆ nâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆo â–ˆâ–ˆ] The target is heavily guarded. Expect resistance, but nothing you canâ€™t handle. Just make sure the chip remains intact.

Vesper: ðŸ’¬ Resistance is standard fare. Iâ€™m more concerned about unexpected surprises. Anything else I should be aware of?

Aether: ðŸ’¬ [Glitch detected: â–ˆâ–ˆdata â–ˆâ–ˆr â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ] Thereâ€™s nothing on your end that should be of concernâ€”unless youâ€™re thinking of going beyond your contract. I wouldnâ€™t recommend that.

Vesper: ðŸ’¬ You know me better than that, Aether. Iâ€™m just here to get paid. Speaking of which, whereâ€™s the drop once I have the chip?

Aether: ðŸ’¬ [File Transfer Initiatedâ€¦ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ] Iâ€™ll provide the drop location once the job is complete. Follow the instructions exactly, and there wonâ€™t be any problems.

Vesper: ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™ll get it done. Just make sure the payment is ready. I donâ€™t work on promises.

Aether: ðŸ’¬ [Warning: Anomalous data detected â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ Virus Installation: â–ˆâ–ˆ%] The funds will be waiting. Donâ€™t disappoint me, Vesper.

Vesper: ðŸ’¬ I never do. Vesper out.
