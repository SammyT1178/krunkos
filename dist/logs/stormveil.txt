[ STORMVEIL ]
Stormveil was an elusive force, more ghost than gang, run by a trio of rogue air elementals: Zephyr, Tempest, and Gale. These elementals were known for disrupting air traffic, hijacking shipments, and causing chaos in the skies above Avaron Rho. Their ability to manipulate the wind and disappear into the air made them nearly impossible to catch. They pulled off heists that other gangs could only dream of, often striking without leaving a trace. But for all their finesse, they didn’t see the [REDACTED] closing in.

Rumor has it, the [REDACTED] tracked Stormveil's movements for months, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. When they finally moved, it wasn’t some grand battle—Stormveil simply vanished. Some say the [REDACTED] trapped the elementals in enchanted conduits, others say they scattered their essence across the city’s power grids. Whatever the case, Stormveil is now just a name that haunts the winds.

[ THE GOLDEN ORDER ]
The Golden Order started as a brotherhood of veterans from the Thousand Year Holy War. Led by Captain Alaric Dorne, these former soldiers believed they were still fighting to protect Avaron Rho from the inside. Alaric and his lieutenants—Seraphina Kade and Markus Raze—ran the gang like a military unit, offering protection to neighborhoods in exchange for loyalty, but in reality, they were shaking down anyone who didn’t pay up. Their sense of "order" was strict and brutal, but they always held themselves as the last righteous warriors in a city that had forgotten them.

Their downfall came when the [REDACTED] saw them as a threat to their growing influence. The [REDACTED] didn't engage them head-on—they infiltrated, broke the Order from within, sowing distrust among Alaric’s lieutenants and turning allies into enemies. By the time anyone in the Golden Order realized what was happening, it was too late. The [REDACTED] dismantled the gang quietly, piece by piece, leaving nothing but rumors of betrayal in their wake.

[ STARSCOURGE ]
Starscourge was all about pushing boundaries. They weren’t content with just running the streets—they wanted to dominate them using cosmic energy and unstable archanotech. Sirus Arkos, their leader, was a visionary... or a madman, depending on who you ask. His lieutenants, Nova Caine and Kallix Tor, were just as fanatical, always experimenting with dangerous tech that most people wouldn’t even touch. Starscourge didn’t just deal in archanotech, they made it deadlier. They didn’t care about safety—only power.

That reckless ambition made them dangerous, but it’s also what got them destroyed. [REDACTED] saw Starscourge as too unpredictable to leave unchecked. When one of Starscourge's larger projects—an archanotech reactor—went unstable, the [REDACTED] used it as the perfect cover to strike. No one knows exactly how they did it, but by the time the reactor blew, Starscourge was already gone, erased from the city like a bad dream.

[ REDMANE ]
Redmane was a gang of mercenaries who fought with ferocity unmatched in Avaron Rho. Their leader, Voss "The Lion" Radek, built Redmane on brute strength and ruthless tactics, taking contracts no one else would touch. Voss, alongside his right-hand warrior Ireva "Redclaw" Vor, ran the gang like a small army, offering their services to the highest bidder. They specialized in heavy combat, and wherever Redmane fought, the streets ran red.

But for all their might, Redmane lacked the subtlety to survive in Avaron Rho's ever-changing underworld. When [REDACTED] set their sights on them, they didn't fight Redmane head-on. Instead, they played the long game, outmaneuvering them in the shadows, cutting off their clients, and turning their allies against them. By the time Voss realized what was happening, the lion had lost its roar. Redmane fell not in battle, but through a quiet, methodical dismantling by the [REDACTED].

[ DEATH'S BLADE ]
Death’s Blade was never about numbers—they thrived on precision. Led by the enigmatic Bladekeeper Thorne, they were feared for their cold, efficient assassinations. Thorne's inner circle—Nera "The Soulkiller" Voss and Kyros Daggerfall—were the best at what they did, taking out high-profile targets without ever being seen. Their reputation for leaving a thin obsidian blade at the scene of each kill made their name known across Avaron Rho. They didn't work for power—they worked for the thrill of the hunt.

But the [REDACTED] doesn’t like competition when it comes to killing in the shadows. Instead of risking open conflict, the [REDACTED] turned Death’s Blade’s own reputation against them. Through a series of staged assassinations, the [REDACTED] framed the gang for murders they didn’t commit, stirring enough attention from the ARPD to bring them crashing down. One by one, Death’s Blade was snuffed out, their leaders disappearing into the same shadows they once ruled.

[ THE GRAFTED SCIONS ]
The Grafted Scions were a gang of twisted idealists, obsessed with self-perfection through archanotech and biological augmentation. Their leader, Silas Ashthorn, believed that true power came from merging flesh and machine, no matter how grotesque the result. His followers, Ravik Ironbone and Kaltra Skorne, were living testaments to that belief, each one grafted with parts that made them more machine than human. They believed in power through augmentation and recruited the desperate, offering them strength in exchange for their bodies.

But as the Scions grew more extreme, they attracted the wrong kind of attention. The [REDACTED] saw them as a grotesque mockery of their own silent, refined power. [REDACTED] agents infiltrated their ranks, subtly sabotaging their grafting techniques. Failed surgeries, infections, and madness followed, causing the Scions to crumble from within. By the time the [REDACTED] moved in for the kill, the Scions were already self-destructing, their grotesque “perfections” turning into their downfall.
